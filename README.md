# IFT402WebServer
A basic managerial webserver created as a capstone project for ASU IFT402.

This project was an attempt at a basic webserver and user friendly front-end. The project was built using Node.js, and packages can be downloaded from the package.json file associated. Express.js was used for the server itself, in conjunction with MongoDB for any data storage. Socket.io was utilized for page updates.

The project was a huge learning experience, and while functional has its share of problems. For anyone attempting to download and run the project from server.js, found in /scr/, a static address to folders within the project exists, and must be modified to the device running the server. Additionally, the MongoDB link no longer exists, so a new database would have to be made and applied to the project.
